## Overview

<!-- Sensu Integration description; supports markdown -->

Collect host metrics (including kubelet hosts) using the Prometheus node_exporter

<!-- Provide a high level overview of the integration contents (e.g. checks, filters, mutators, handlers, assets, etc) -->

This integration provides the following resources:

* `node_exporter` [check].

## Dashboards

<!-- List of supported dashboards w/ screenshots (supports png, jpeg, and gif images; relative paths only; e.g. `![](img/dashboard-1.png)` )-->


## Setup

<!-- Sensu Integration setup instructions, including Sensu agent configuration and external component configuration -->
<!-- EXAMPLE: what configuration (if any) is required in a third-party service to enable monitoring? -->

1. Ensure `wget` is available as a command to use by the Sensu agent process. 
   
   **Note:** official Sensu container image includes wget

2. Configure the `NODE_EXPORTER_HOST` environment variable to the host IP address.
      For Sensu Agents running as a Kubernetes daemonset this can be configured
      via the `ClusterFirstWithHostNet` [Kubernetes dnsPolicy][dns_policy], and using the 
      [Kubernetes Downward API][downward_api] to expose the host IP address as an environment variable,
      as follows:

```yaml      
      env:
      - name: NODE_EXPORTER_HOST
        valueFrom:
          fieldRef:
            fieldPath: status.hostIP
```
     **Note:**: The value of $NODE_EXPORTER_HOST can also be managed via the env_vars field in
     the CheckConfig spec.

3. Configure a `node_metrics_port` Sensu entity label to customize the port
      that should be used to scrape metrics from the node_exporter (default: 9100).

4. Add the `daemonset` [subscription] to [agents] that should run this check.
